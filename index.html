        <p> <blockquote> <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>My childhood is just that simple, but full of memories.<sup>2</sup> Memorable events in my life and of course memorable people.<sup>3</sup> I was born in Micronesia, USA and then my grandmother took me home to the Philippines when I was two(2) months old.<sup>4</sup> I grew up here in Malabon City with my grandparents together with my mother’s siblings.<sup>5</sup>
            Even if I was away from my real family, I was still thankful for my grandparents because of how well they took care of me.<sup>6</sup> If I'm going to be honest, when I was a kid I was jealous of how my family lived, because I was here in the Philippines and they’re still in Micronesia, USA living happily together.<sup>7</sup> But I came to realize that me being here with my grandparents and my uncles and aunties helped me to become what I am now.<sup>8</sup> I always think that it would’ve been different if my grandmother did not take me from the US.<sup>9</sup> My childhood was really memorable, just like other people’s experiences.<sup>10</sup> Playing in the streets, getting beaten by a hanger or a belt by your elders, getting scolded by your elders, and more.<sup>11</sup> Like I said, just like other people’s childhood experiences.<sup>12</sup> And when I said memorable people, my uncle who’s been like a brother to me won’t miss the top list, because growing up we’re always together.<sup>13</sup> I think he is also the one who shaped my character when I was a kid until now.<sup>14</sup> We have many similar characteristics.<sup>15</sup> When you say memories, we all think about the best or the worst experiences we ever had.<sup>16</sup> One memory I recall was how influential wrestling became for me.<sup>17</sup> I was literally crazy about them.<sup>18</sup> Watching them all the time, copying what they do, my cousins and I even wrestle in our room most of the time.<sup>19</sup> That’s how influential wrestling is for us.<sup>20</sup> I think that was one of the most memorable things I’ve done of course based on my life right now, seeing them again on our screens and get to recall every single thing you have done because of them, it always feels nostalgic.<sup>21</sup> If we’re going to talk about academics, I think I excelled from my 1st grade until my 3rd grade.<sup>22</sup> If you would ask why, well because I focused too much on extra curricular activities and of course my silliness.<sup>23</sup> I didn’t do well in school but I made sure that I would still have the most fun.<sup>24</sup> I became a lyrist at my school’s drum and lyre band, became a member of the student council, a volunteer at Save the Children, a volunteer at the Red cross, and this is where I started my career as a Student-Athlete.<sup>25</sup> Won Regional competition and I also won the Palarong Pambansa which is one of the biggest competitions here in the Philippines.<sup>26</sup> Winning gave me a lot of opportunities and opened the door that will give me a chance to study at big schools such as University of the East.<sup>27</sup>

It was really a big achievement for me and I realized that doing this sport is what I love.<sup>11</sup> I just have to do what is right and everything will follow.<sup>12</sup> But after everything went down, This is where the virus and pandemic started.<sup>13</sup> Right after the dreams begin to be clear, there goes the challenges that will strike you in the face.<sup>14</sup> I didn’t know what to do during those days.<sup>15</sup> I can only open my laptop and my phone, that is where our life circled basically.<sup>16</sup> Because of the challenges I faced and hard times I experienced, I got kicked out of the team.<sup>17</sup> It took out my scholarship.<sup>18</sup> I didn’t know what to do and I cried when my coach said it directly to me.<sup>19</sup> I told my parents that I won’t have my scholarship for my last year of high school and that I’ll need money to finish my school.<sup>20</sup> Thankfully, my parents still gave me a chance to study in University of the East and graduate high school.<sup>21</sup>

            <sup>1</sup>Summer after I graduated from high school, I had this thought that came into my mind.<sup>2</sup>
What if I try again and be an athlete again? I would get to study in big schools and I won’t have to worry about the funds that I would need for me to study in such.<sup>3</sup> And then I started to search for schools that are open for tryouts.<sup>4</sup> Then one day, my coach from UE messaged me that they will have a tryout and I said that I’m going to be there, then suddenly I realized that on the day of tryouts, I also have a research defense on the same day.<sup>5</sup> I honestly didn’t know what to do, I didn’t know if I would still make it to the tryouts.<sup>6</sup> Fast forward to that day, The defense was successful but I’m still having a hard time if I’d still go to the tryouts because I might be late for it and then someone pushed me and told me that I should go after it.<sup>7</sup> I packed my clothes and shoes and then got to the tryouts.<sup>8</sup> When I got there, my coach gave me a condition that If I would be able to do what I did when I won the silver medal in my high school year, he would give me a scholarship for college, and in God’s grace I did it! I really believe that it was all God’s plan.<sup>9</sup> I am thankful for all the things that he has done for me and all of the things that I’ve experienced growing up.<sup>10</sup> While I'm writing this down, right now I'm a 2nd year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.<sup>11</sup> If you would ask me why, well because I was curious.<sup>12</sup> I was curious on how these websites work, how  these games work, basically everything that runs in a computer.<sup>13</sup> I wanted to know how they run through a computer.<sup>14</sup> I want to know how they became everything possible inside a computer.<sup>15</sup> Right now I was amazed that I'm learning all about it and I can say that I'm really interested about all of it.<sup>16</sup> It's not that easy but if I really keep working hard, I'll be where I want myself to be.<sup>17</sup> Every dream was just a thought on your mind at first, until you want it and work hard for it.<sup>18</sup> And every single dream is still here in me and I know that it was planted here in my head for a reason.<sup>19</sup> I’ll make sure that every sacrifices and challenges I overcome won't be put to waste.<sup>20</sup> I know that I just have to keep going and that’s what I’m going to do.<sup>21</sup>I'm Rainier Paul Caranto, and I am a Dreamer.<sup>22</sup>
